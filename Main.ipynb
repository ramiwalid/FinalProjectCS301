    "USA House Prices Dataset\n",
    "- This comprehensive dataset outlines an extensive list of factors and circumstances that impact the US housing market and detail how each sale and purchase in the US contributes to the overall market. The USA housing market being such a large sector of the market for investors and entrepreneurs makes understanding and analyzing trends essential. This dataset contains 14 descriptive features, both categorical and numerical, that can help us train a model and determine a prediction on housing prices based on housing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of Each Feature:\n",
    "- Date\n",
    "  - Sale date of the property. Critical in understanding the climate of the housing market at the time of sale for the specific property. Can help us isolate trends and changes in the market.\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "  - Sale price of the property in USD. Sale price is the target variable that our models are aiming to predict based on the other housing features.\n",
    "- Bedrooms\n",
    "  - Numerical count of bedrooms in the property. This feature is critical in predicting property value because bedrooms tend to be directly proportional with value. The more bedrooms, the more expensive the property.\n",
    "- Bathrooms\n",
    "  - Numerical count of bathrooms in the property. Like the bedroom feature, this is important in value predictions because typically the more bathrooms, the more expensive the property.\n",
    "- Sqft Living\n",
    "  - Size of the living area measured in square feet. This is one of the most important features for model training because square footage is one of the biggest factors in concluding the price of a property.\n",
    "- Sqft Lot\n",
    "  - Size of the lot measured in square feet. The lot of a property is a highly sought after factor when buyers look into a property so this statistic will help will determining price of a property.\n",
    "- Floors\n",
    "  - Numerical count of floors in the property. Generally speaking, the more floors a property has, the more square footage you have and this aids in price determination.\n",
    "- Waterfront\n",
    "  - Binary feature that contains 1 if the property has a waterfront view and 0 if the property has no waterfront view. Depending on the area and state the property resides in, a waterfront view is essential for buyers so this is a large determinant in property value.\n",
    "- View\n",
    "  - A numerical feature that ranks the view from the property from 0 to 4. The higher the index of the property's view, the more desirable it is for buyers.\n",
    "- Condition\n",
    "  - A numerical feature that ranks the condition of the property from 1 to 5. Needless to say, the higher the index of the condition, the more desirable the property is.\n",
    "- Sqft Above\n",
    "  - Size of the property above the basement measured in square feet. This feature aids in isolating the value of the property from above ground as opposed to combining it with the below ground value.\n",
    "- Sqft Basement\n",
    "  - Size of the basement measured in square feet. Similar to the last feature, buyers often value a larger basement and this is critical in understanding the full context of a property.\n",
    "- Yr Built\n",
    "  - Year the property was built. Year built provides context to the property; where an older property might contain some historical value and a newer property would boast modern features and ammenities you won't find in an older property.\n",
    "- Yr Renovated\n",
    "  - Year the property was last renovated. Recent renovations can increase a property's appeal and value as modern and more advanced features can be implemented.\n",
    "- Street\n",
    "  - The street address of the property. This feature aids in determining the location of the property which has a big impact on the features of the property because different areas have a different housing market than others.\n",
    "- City\n",
    "  - The city the property is located. Like the last feature, this is important for determining location-specific trends.\n",
    "- Statezip\n",
    "  - The state and zip code of the property. Works hand in hand with the street and city features to determine location-specific trends.\n",
    "- Country\n",
    "  - The country where the property is located. Most of the properties in this dataset are located in USA but this is a necessary feature to complete the other location-based features.\n",
    " \n",
    "Features For Model Training\n",
    "- Sqft Living\n",
    "- House Age\n",
    "- Renovated (Binary)\n",
    "- Sqft Per Room (Total Square Feet / Total Rooms)\n",
    "- Basement Ratio (Sqft of Basement / Sqft of Living Space)\n",
    "- Total Rooms (Bedrooms + Bathrooms)\n",
    "- Above Ground Ratio (Sqft Above Ground / Sqft of Living Space)\n",
    "- Price\n",
    "- Sqft Lot\n",
    "- Floors\n",
    "- Waterfront\n",
    "- View\n",
    "- Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the above features are critical in understanding the features of the property and how they'll perform in the housing market relative to the sale date of the property. Most of these features are directly proportional to total property value and will be useful in training our models to predict the sale price of properties based on their features. Some features have been optimized, consolidated, or encoded to provide a bit more conclusive or useful information for predictions by our model."
